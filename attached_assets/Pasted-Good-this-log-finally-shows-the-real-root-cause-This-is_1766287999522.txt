Good, this log finally shows the **real root cause**. This is now a clean, deterministic fix.

---

## Root Cause (Confirmed)

The build is failing because **React Native Reanimated now requires the New Architecture**, but your build environment is explicitly disabling it.

The critical line is:

```
[Reanimated] Reanimated requires the New Architecture to be enabled.
If you have `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0` set in your environment you should remove it.
```

So what is happening is:

* `react-native-reanimated` is installed (directly or via another library)
* Expo is generating iOS native code
* The environment variable `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0` is present
* Reanimated’s podspec hard-fails when New Architecture is disabled
* `pod install` aborts, so the archive never even starts

This is **not** a Fastlane issue and **not** an iOS 26 issue. It is purely an architecture flag mismatch.

---

## Why This Suddenly Broke

Recent versions of:

* `react-native-reanimated`
* Expo SDK (49+)
* React Native 0.73+

have tightened enforcement around the New Architecture (Fabric + TurboModules).

Previously this produced warnings. Now it produces **hard failures**.

---

## The Correct Fix (Do This Exactly)

### Step 1: Explicitly ENABLE the New Architecture

In your `app.json` or `app.config.ts`, add this:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "jsEngine": "hermes",
    "newArchEnabled": true
  }
}
```

This is the **single most important fix**.

---

### Step 2: Remove Any Overrides That Disable It

Search your project for **any** of the following and remove them if present:

* `.env`
* `.env.production`
* `eas.json`
* GitHub Actions
* Replit secrets

Specifically remove:

```
RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0
```

If it exists anywhere, Reanimated will fail again.

---

### Step 3: Clean and Regenerate Native Code

Do **not** skip this.

```bash
rm -rf ios
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

This regenerates the Podfile with New Architecture enabled.

---

### Step 4: Rebuild with Cache Cleared

```bash
eas build -p ios --clear-cache
```

At this point:

* `pod install` will succeed
* Archive will proceed
* Fastlane will stop failing at gym

---

## Why This Fix Is Safe for Your App

Your app is already compatible because:

* You are using Expo modules
* You are using Hermes
* You are using modern navigation and animation libraries
* Your UI is already Fabric-safe

Enabling New Architecture is now the **default forward path** for Expo apps. You are not taking on technical debt, you are removing it.

## Common Follow-Up Questions (Preemptively Answered)

### Do I need to change my JS code?

No.

### Will this affect Android?

No negative impact. Android already defaults closer to the new architecture path.

### Will App Store review be affected?

No. Apple does not see or care about React Native architecture flags.

### Should I downgrade Reanimated instead?

No. Downgrading will cause other Expo modules to break later.

## Summary

* The error is real and clearly identified
* The fix is simple and correct
* You do **not** need to rebuild the app
* You do **not** need to touch Fastlane
* You do **not** need to change signing

Enable New Architecture, clean, rebuild.

If you want, next I can:

* Verify your `eas.json` and `app.config.ts`
* Confirm no hidden env vars remain
* Walk you through a minimal production-safe config

Apply the steps above and tell me when you rerun the build.
