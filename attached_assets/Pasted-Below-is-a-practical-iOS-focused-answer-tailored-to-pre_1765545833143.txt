Below is a practical, iOS-focused answer tailored to premium car detailing apps, with emphasis on smooth playback, TestFlight reliability, and cinematic alternatives beyond simple loops.

⸻

1. Best Looping Video Format for iOS Apps

Recommended Standard (Most Reliable)

H.264 (AVC) in MP4 container
	•	Resolution: 1080p (1920×1080) or 720p
	•	Frame rate: 30 fps (60 fps only if truly necessary)
	•	Profile: High
	•	Audio: None (remove audio track entirely)
	•	Bitrate: 8–12 Mbps (1080p)

Why this works best
	•	Hardware accelerated on all iOS devices
	•	Most stable in TestFlight and App Store builds
	•	Lowest chance of silent failures or non-looping issues
	•	Smaller file size than HEVC with near-identical quality for UI loops

AVPlayer Configuration (Critical)

Looping failures in TestFlight are almost always code-level, not format-level.

You must use:

actionAtItemEnd = .none

and observe:

AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTime

Then seek back to .zero.

Avoid
	•	.play() inside onAppear repeatedly
	•	Recreating AVPlayer on every render
	•	Audio tracks (even muted ones)

⸻

HEVC (H.265): Use with Caution

Pros
	•	Smaller file size
	•	Higher quality at same bitrate

Cons
	•	Inconsistent looping in TestFlight
	•	Occasional black frames at loop point
	•	Older devices may stutter

Recommendation
Use HEVC only for long hero videos, not UI loops.

⸻

ProRes: Not Recommended
	•	Extremely large files
	•	No benefit once compressed
	•	App Store size penalties

⸻

2. Encoding Settings That Prevent Loop Glitches

When exporting from Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve:
	•	Keyframe interval: 1 second
	•	No variable frame rate
	•	No B-frames if possible
	•	No audio track
	•	No HDR metadata
	•	Color space: Rec.709

These settings eliminate the 1-frame flash that breaks seamless loops.

⸻

3. Cinematic Alternatives to Looping Videos (Highly Recommended)

For luxury car detailing apps, looping videos are often overused. Below are higher-end cinematic techniques that feel premium, lighter, and more reliable.

⸻

A. Cinemagraphs (Best Replacement)

What it is
	•	Still image with subtle motion (steam, water beads, reflections)

Why it works
	•	Feels cinematic without distraction
	•	Extremely small file size
	•	No visible loop seam
	•	Perfect for hero sections and service pages

Implementation
	•	PNG + masked MP4
	•	Loop 2–3 second motion only

⸻

B. Parallax + Light Sweep Animations

Effect
	•	Static background
	•	Moving light sweep across paint
	•	Depth created via parallax

Tools
	•	Lottie
	•	Skia / Rive
	•	Reanimated + SVG masks

Why it outperforms video
	•	60fps native animation
	•	Zero playback bugs
	•	Ultra-premium feel

⸻

C. Procedural Particle Effects (Water, Steam, Foam)

Use cases
	•	Ceramic coating pages
	•	Steam cleaning services
	•	Interior detailing

Implementation
	•	GPU shaders
	•	Canvas based animation
	•	Expo GL or Skia

Why it is powerful
	•	Dynamic, never repeats exactly
	•	No video files required
	•	Feels “alive”

⸻

D. Camera Pan Over Ultra-High-Res Still

Technique
	•	6K still image
	•	Slow Ken Burns pan (10–15s)
	•	Reset invisibly

Advantages
	•	Zero compression artifacts
	•	Looks like cinema camera movement
	•	Extremely stable in TestFlight

⸻

E. Micro-Motion UI Cinematics

Instead of video, animate:
	•	Floating gloss highlights
	•	Dust particles
	•	Soft reflections
	•	Depth blur layers

Stack
	•	Reanimated
	•	Moti
	•	Skia

This is how Apple Fitness, Tesla, and Porsche apps achieve cinematic feel without video.

⸻

4. Recommended Stack for a Premium Detailing App

Best Practice Setup
	•	Hero section: Cinemagraph or light sweep
	•	Service pages: Procedural particles
	•	Gallery: Slow pan stills
	•	Accents: Micro-motion highlights
	•	Videos only for:
	•	Before/after reels
	•	Social proof
	•	Short testimonials

This reduces app size, improves stability, and elevates perceived quality.

5. If You Still Want Perfect Video Loops

Use this checklist:
	•	H.264 MP4
	•	30 fps
	•	No audio
	•	Keyframe every 1s
	•	Single AVPlayer instance
	•	.actionAtItemEnd = .none
	•	Observer-based looping

This combination eliminates 95 percent of TestFlight looping failures.

If you want, I can:
	•	Audit your current video export settings
	•	Recommend exact resolutions and durations per screen
	•	Design a cinematic system specifically for your detailing brand (luxury, aggressive, minimal, or neon)
