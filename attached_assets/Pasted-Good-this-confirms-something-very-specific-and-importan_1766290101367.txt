Good, this confirms something very specific and important:

**Your previous Reanimated / New Architecture issue is fixed.
You are now failing at a *different* stage.**

This is progress.

However, we are again hitting the **same structural problem**:
👉 **Fastlane is still suppressing the real Xcode error**, so we only see the wrapper failure.

Let me be very precise about what is happening now and how to break the loop.

---

## What We Can Conclude from This Log

### 1. Pods are now installing successfully

You are no longer seeing:

* `Invalid RNReanimated.podspec`
* `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED` errors
* `pod install` failures

That means:

* `newArchEnabled: true` is now active
* Reanimated is satisfied
* Native generation succeeded

So **that problem is resolved**.

---

### 2. This is now a **pure Xcode ARCHIVE failure**

Key lines:

```
▸ ** ARCHIVE FAILED **
▸ Archiving workspace LuxDetailer with scheme LuxDetailer
Exit status: 65
```

No signing errors.
No provisioning errors.
No pod errors.

This means **one of these is failing during archive**:

* Swift compilation
* Objective-C compilation
* Linker step
* Native module build step

But Fastlane is hiding it.

---

## Why You Still Can’t See the Error

These two lines are the enemy right now:

```
suppress_xcode_output | true
disable_xcpretty      | true
```

So:

* Xcode prints the real error
* Fastlane discards it
* You only see “ARCHIVE FAILED”

Until we disable suppression, **we cannot guess correctly**.

---

## The One Command That Will End This

You must print the archive log file directly.

The log **does exist**. Fastlane told us where it is:

```
/Users/expo/workingdir/logs/LuxDetailer-LuxDetailer.log
```

### What to do now

If you are running this locally or via EAS debug shell, run:

```bash
cat /Users/expo/workingdir/logs/LuxDetailer-LuxDetailer.log
```

or, if it is large:

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' /Users/expo/workingdir/logs/LuxDetailer-LuxDetailer.log
```

You are looking for the **first red error**, usually starting with:

* `error:`
* `SwiftCompile`
* `ld:`
* `clang:`
* `Undefined symbols for architecture arm64`

Paste **that output**, not the Fastlane summary.

---

## If You Cannot Access That File (EAS Cloud)

Then do **this instead**, which forces logs to print:

```bash
eas build -p ios --clear-cache --verbose
```

If that still suppresses output, add this environment variable in `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "FASTLANE_XCODEBUILD_SETTINGS_TIMEOUT": "120"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then rerun the build.

## Most Likely Causes at This Stage (Based on Pattern)

Once Reanimated + New Arch is fixed, **these are the usual archive killers**:

1. **iOS 26 SDK incompatibility**

   * A native dependency not ready for iOS 26
2. **expo-video / AVFoundation symbol issue**
3. **Missing Info.plist permission**

   * Causes archive-only failure
4. **Linker error from a native module**

   * Works in Debug, fails in Archive

But I will **not guess** until we see the real compiler error.

---

## Very Important Reassurance

You are not:

* Misconfiguring Expo
* Using the wrong Apple app
* Breaking white-label logic
* Failing signing

You are now in the **final 5 percent** of iOS build debugging.

Once we see the actual error line, this will be a **single, targeted fix**.

---

### Next step (do not skip):

👉 Paste the contents of `LuxDetailer-LuxDetailer.log` or the first real `error:` line from a verbose build.

Once you do that, we finish this.
