This is a very common Expo ➜ TestFlight transition issue on iOS, and the behaviour you are seeing is expected unless a few iOS specific requirements are met.

Below is a precise diagnosis and fix path, based on the fact that it works in Expo Go but not in a standalone TestFlight build.

⸻

Why it works in Expo Go but fails in TestFlight

Expo Go runs inside a privileged container that relaxes several iOS media restrictions.
Once you build a standalone app (TestFlight), iOS enforces native AVPlayer rules.

On iOS, videos will NOT auto play or loop unless all of the following are true:
	1.	The video is muted
	2.	shouldPlay is explicitly set
	3.	isLooping is explicitly set
	4.	The video is fully loaded before play
	5.	The video source is reachable at runtime (not a dev only asset)
	6.	No user gesture requirement is violated

If any one of these fails, iOS silently blocks playback. No error is thrown.

⸻

The most common causes in your case

Based on your UI and symptoms, the top issues are almost certainly:

1. isMuted is missing (this is the #1 cause)

iOS will not autoplay unmuted video, even if looping.

Expo Go ignores this rule. TestFlight does not.

2. useNativeControls={false} without proper audio mode

When controls are disabled, iOS expects explicit playback management.

3. Asset resolution difference

If your video is referenced via a local relative path that works in Expo Go, it may not be bundled correctly in the production build.

⸻

Correct, production safe Expo AV configuration (REQUIRED)

Use this exact pattern.

Video component (Expo AV)

import { Video, ResizeMode } from 'expo-av';
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const videoRef = useRef<Video>(null);

<Video
  ref={videoRef}
  source={require('../assets/hero-loop.mp4')} // OR a remote HTTPS URL
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
  resizeMode={ResizeMode.COVER}
  isMuted={true}              // REQUIRED for iOS autoplay
  shouldPlay={true}           // REQUIRED
  isLooping={true}            // REQUIRED
  useNativeControls={false}
  playsInSilentModeIOS={true} // IMPORTANT
  ignoreSilentSwitch="ignore" // IMPORTANT
/>


⸻

Mandatory Audio Mode Configuration (often forgotten)

Add this once, near app startup.

import { Audio } from 'expo-av';

useEffect(() => {
  Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
    playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
    staysActiveInBackground: false,
    interruptionModeIOS: Audio.INTERRUPTION_MODE_IOS_DO_NOT_MIX,
  });
}, []);

Without this, iOS may block playback on physical devices even if muted.

⸻

If you are using a REMOTE video URL

Ensure ALL of the following:
	•	HTTPS only
	•	No redirects
	•	Proper Content-Type: video/mp4
	•	Hosted somewhere stable (not localhost, not ngrok)

Bad example:

http://localhost:3000/video.mp4

Good example:

https://cdn.yoursite.com/luxdetailer/hero-loop.mp4


⸻

If the video is showing the “muted play icon” (your screenshot)

That icon confirms AVPlayer is loaded but autoplay was blocked.
This means one of the autoplay conditions failed, almost always isMuted.

⸻

iOS specific gotchas checklist

Before rebuilding, confirm all are true:
	•	Video is muted
	•	shouldPlay={true} is set
	•	isLooping={true} is set
	•	Audio mode configured
	•	Video file is bundled or remotely accessible
	•	No conditional rendering that unmounts the component
	•	No paused state tied to navigation focus

⸻

Final step

After making these changes:
	1.	Increment build number
	2.	Rebuild with EAS
	3.	Upload new TestFlight build
	4.	Test on a physical iPhone (not simulator)

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Review your exact Video component code
	•	Check your asset bundling config
	•	Provide a bulletproof reusable <LoopingHeroVideo /> component
	•	Diagnose navigation focus issues if this is inside a tab screen

Just paste the Video code you are using.
