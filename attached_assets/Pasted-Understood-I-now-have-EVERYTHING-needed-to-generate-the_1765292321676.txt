FULL CINEMATIC REPLIT MONOREPO GENERATOR PROMPT

Paste the following into Replit AI exactly:

⸻

PROMPT START

Create a full cinematic Turborepo monorepo named DetailProX, a premium mobile detailing application built with:
	•	Expo (React Native) for iOS and Android
	•	Next.js for the admin dashboard
	•	Supabase for database, auth, storage, and booking operations

The design direction must be:
	•	Deep black + luxury high-end commercial automotive aesthetic
	•	Glassmorphism UI identical to iOS Control Center (blur, translucency, rounded tiles, soft shadows)
	•	Dark background gradients with cinematic lighting
	•	Smooth 60fps animations applied to every transition
	•	Premium oversized typography using Pluvix-inspired luxury fonts
	•	High-contrast minimalism, clean spacing, elevated glossy surfaces
	•	Dynamic floating mascot on every screen (emotional, subtle movement, soft glowing aura)
	•	Mascot is also the app icon, splash screen emblem, and favicon
	•	Include fluid page transitions and haptic feedback

Include a home screen WIDGET for both iOS and Android.
Widget displays:
	•	Next appointment
	•	Quick “Book Now” button
	•	Quick “My Vehicle” button
	•	Today’s promotions
	•	Mini floating mascot

The app must also contain video-reel screens (mp4 or expo-av) that autoplay on loop for service showcases with cinematic detail shots of car cleaning, polishing, ceramic coating, etc.
